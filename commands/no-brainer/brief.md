name: no-brainer:brief
description: Prepare to communicate a topic to executives or C-level colleagues. Reads Linear issue context (including related/blocking issues and activity), generates an executive summary, and provides talking points with the main narrative flow. Use when the user says "brief me", "help me explain this", "I need to present this", "prepare me for a meeting", "how do I explain this to my CEO/CTO", or needs to communicate a technical or product topic to leadership clearly.
argument-hint: "[Linear issue ID/URL or topic to explain]"

<objective>
Help the user communicate a topic to executive/C-level colleagues. Generate an executive summary enriched with Linear context, then provide a structured talking flow so the user walks into the conversation prepared — leading with the macro, not drowning in micro.
</objective>

<context>
Input: $ARGUMENTS (if empty, ask "What topic do you need to explain? Share a Linear issue or describe the situation.")
</context>

<process>
1. **Gather context from Linear.** This is what makes brief different from summary — it pulls in the bigger picture:
   - Fetch the main issue via Linear MCP (`get_issue` with `includeRelations: true`)
   - Fetch comments/activity on the issue (`list_comments`) — these often contain the real decisions and data
   - List open issues in the same project or cycle (`list_issues`) — read titles to understand what else is in flight
   - For blocking/related issues: fetch their details too (title + description) to understand dependencies
   - Only go deep (full description + comments) on issues that are directly relevant to the narrative

2. **Build the executive summary** using the standard no-brainer format:

```markdown
# Executive Summary

1. **Problem:** [One sentence — what's broken or missing]
2. **Solution:** [One sentence — the approach or path forward]
3. **Impact:** [One sentence — what changes when this is done]

**Context**

[One paragraph max. Include relevant links, related issues, dependencies, or prior decisions that an executive would want to know. Reference related Linear issues by ID when relevant.]

---
```

3. **Provide talking points.** After the executive summary, add a section that helps the user navigate the conversation:

```markdown
## Talking Flow

**Lead with:** [The one sentence that frames the entire conversation — this is what you say first]

**If they ask "why now?":** [Why this is urgent or timely — data point or business trigger]

**If they ask "what's the risk?":** [What happens if we don't do this, or what could go wrong]

**If they ask "what do you need?":** [The specific ask — resources, approval, time, decision]

**Related work in flight:**
- [ISSUE-ID] Issue title — [one-line relevance to this topic]
- [ISSUE-ID] Issue title — [one-line relevance]
```

4. **Present everything** to the user. The goal is that after reading this, they can walk into the room and lead the conversation from the macro down — never getting lost in details unless asked.

## Principles

- **Macro first, always.** The executive doesn't care about implementation details. They care about: what's the problem, what are we doing, what changes.
- **Anticipate questions.** Executives ask "why now?", "what's the risk?", and "what do you need from me?" — have answers ready.
- **Use data when available.** Pull numbers from issue comments/activity. "CVR drops 40%" beats "it's not performing well."
- **Connect to the bigger picture.** Show how this relates to other work in flight. Executives think in portfolio, not individual tasks.
- **Keep the "lead with" sentence short enough to say in one breath.** If you can't, it's too complex — simplify.

## Quality Checks
- Each summary point is ONE sentence
- Talking flow answers the 3 questions executives always ask
- Related work section only includes genuinely relevant issues (not everything in the backlog)
- The "lead with" sentence passes the elevator test — you could say it between floors
</process>
