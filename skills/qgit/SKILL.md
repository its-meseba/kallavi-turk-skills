name: qgit
description: Quick git add, commit, and push in one shot. Use when the user says "git add commit push", "qgit", "commit and push", "push this", "ship it", or any variation of wanting to stage, commit, and push changes without lengthy back-and-forth. Also triggers on "/qgit". This skill is about speed — get it done, report the result, move on.

# qgit — Quick Git Ship

Stage, commit, and push in one fluid motion. No unnecessary output, no hand-holding.

## Process

### 1. Gather context (parallel)

Run these three commands simultaneously:

- `git status` — see what's changed and untracked (never use `-uall`)
- `git diff --stat` — summary of staged + unstaged changes
- `git log --oneline -5` — recent commit style reference

### 2. Stage files

- Add changed and relevant untracked files by name — not `git add .` or `git add -A`
- Skip files that look like secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens)
- If nothing to commit, say so and stop

### 3. Commit

Write a concise commit message that matches the repo's existing style (from the log). Focus on the "why" not the "what". Use a HEREDOC for formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Your message here

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 4. Push

```bash
git push
```

If there's no upstream, use `git push -u origin <branch>`.

### 5. Report

One line: the commit hash, branch, and what was pushed. Done.

## Rules

- Never amend unless explicitly asked — always create new commits
- Never force push
- Never skip hooks (`--no-verify`)
- If a pre-commit hook fails: fix the issue, re-stage, create a NEW commit (don't amend)
- If push fails due to remote changes: inform the user, don't auto-rebase
- Keep all output minimal — the user chose qgit because they want speed, not commentary
