# LinkedIn Newsletter Generation

**Created by Nazım** — 4 Kallavi Turks

A skill for generating polished, analytically rigorous LinkedIn content with strict quality gates.

## Key Differences from Standard LinkedIn Generation

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 only
- **Output**: 1 long post (not 5 variations)
- **Images**: 1 image (not 3)
- **Blog Integration**: Automatically adds to personal blog (personal-blog-semih)

---

## When to Use

- Generate a LinkedIn newsletter post on any topic
- Create analytical, Paul Graham-style long-form content
- Build content that demonstrates structured thinking

---

## Rules Files (All Required)

This skill uses the following rule files (embedded):

1. **Structural Exclusions** — What NOT to write about
2. **Evidence Bank** — Decision contexts and constraints
3. **Language & Reasoning Constitution** — How reasoning is expressed
4. **LinkedIn Operating Principles** — Content standards
5. **Personal Analytical Playbook** — Risk posture and stage-based analysis
6. **Language & Expression Rules** — Sentence-level rules
7. **Paul Graham Exception Layer** — Style overrides when requested
8. **Image Generation Rules** — How to create visuals
9. **Blog Integration** — How to add posts to personal blog
10. **Reference Writers Modules** — Calibration framework for intellectual rigor
11. **Rewrite Instructions** — Concept → Accessible essay transformation
12. **Series Recommendations Rule** — For series posts, create recommendations.md
13. **Styling** — Visual guidelines for images
14. **Writing Style** — Paul Graham writing techniques

## Phase 1: Topic Qualification

Before generating, verify the topic passes these gates:

**Gate 1: Evidence** — Topic must connect to:
- A Decision Context (C1-C7) from Evidence Bank
- An Observed Constraint (K1-K6)
- A Recurrent Failure Mode (F1-F5)

**Gate 2: Exclusion** — Reject if topic:
- Relies on personal experience, motivation, generic advice
- Makes universal claims without localization
- Substitutes narrative for mechanism
- States preferences without trade-offs
- Calls outcomes/predictions
- Fetishizes tools/frameworks
- Over-claims confidence

**Gate 3: Confidence** — B1/B2 domains = structural analysis only. B3 = silence.

**Gate 4: Style** — If "Paul Graham Style" requested, apply the exception layer.

## Phase 2: Pre-Generation Setup

1. **Select Primary Category** (from reference writers):
   - A: Behavioral Econ, B: Microecon, C: Game Theory, D: Macroecon
   - E: Institutional, F: Dev Econ, G: Uncertainty, H: Strategy
   - I: M&A, J: Market, K: Finance, PG: Paul Graham

2. **Identify Trade-Off**:
   - Capital/Optionality, Speed/Reversibility, Efficiency/Resilience
   - Scale/Control, Precision/Robustness, Local/System
   - Info/Action, Incentive/Autonomy

3. **Determine Risk Posture**:
   - Early (Downside-first)
   - Mid (Option-value)
   - Later (Asymmetry-seeking)

## Phase 3: Generation (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

**Model**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` or latest Sonnet 4.5

Generate **1 long post** (not 5). Apply:

### Structural Template

1. **Observation** — A concrete pattern, mistake, or tension
2. **Underlying Mechanism** — Incentives, constraints, or assumptions
3. **Implication** — How this should change decision-making
4. **Clean Stop** — End without CTA, question, or summary

### Writing Style

- Use Paul Graham style language (plain, direct, counter-intuitive)
- No "I" for authority — use only for framing
- Static verbs, precise nouns
- No em-dashes, lists, or motivational tone
- Trade-offs must be explicit

---

## Phase 4: Image Generation

Generate **1 image** following:

1. **Ideation**: Identify 1 object/metaphor strongly associated with topic
2. **Styling**: Navy blue dominant (#1a365d), stylized, geometric, wireframe or glass-morphism
3. **Requirements**: Abstract/geometric, no humans/text, premium/intellectual feel
4. **Output**: Save to `posts/[topic-slug]/images/1.png`

---

## Phase 5: Blog Integration

After generating the LinkedIn post, add to personal blog:

1. **Create MDX**: `personal-blog-semih/app/(post)/2026/[slug]/page.mdx`
2. **Register in posts.json**: Add entry to `personal-blog-semih/app/posts.json`
3. **Update llms.txt**: Add URL to `personal-blog-semih/public/llms.txt`

See `personal-blog-semih/docs/integration/integration.md` for full details.

---

## Output Structure

```
posts/[topic-slug]/
├── version-long.md        # The 1 long post
└── images/
    └── 1.png              # Generated image
```

---

## Quality Gate (Final Check)

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Decision context explicit?
- [ ] Constraints named?
- [ ] Trade-off exposed?
- [ ] Risk posture appropriate?
- [ ] Abstraction localized?
- [ ] No prescription?
- [ ] Would a consultant/investor respect this?
- [ ] Is it interesting without my name?

If any fails, regenerate.
