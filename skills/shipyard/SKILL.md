# Shipyard

Professional mobile app development automation. One skill to set up, configure, and manage every SDK, CLI tool, and dashboard your app needs — across iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin/Compose), Flutter, and React Native (Expo).

## Philosophy

**CLI-first, browser-fallback, code-always.** Every action follows this priority:
1. **CLI tool** — fastest, scriptable, repeatable (adapty, asc, firebase, posthog)
2. **REST API** — when CLI doesn't cover it (curl with auth tokens)
3. **Playwright browser** — when dashboards have no API (visual builders, OAuth flows)
4. **Manual guidance** — last resort, with exact click-by-click instructions

## Platform Detection

Before any setup, detect the project platform:

```
project.yml / *.xcodeproj     → iOS (SwiftUI)
build.gradle.kts / build.gradle → Android (Kotlin/Compose)
pubspec.yaml                   → Flutter
package.json + app.json/app.config.js → React Native (Expo)
```

Adapt ALL SDK integration patterns to the detected platform:
- **iOS**: SPM packages in `project.yml` or `Package.swift`, Swift service classes, `@MainActor` patterns
- **Android**: Gradle dependencies, Kotlin service classes, Hilt DI
- **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml` dependencies, Dart service classes, Provider/Riverpod
- **React Native**: `package.json` dependencies, TypeScript service modules, hooks

## SDK Registry

| SDK | Purpose | CLI | MCP | Install Skill |
|-----|---------|-----|-----|---------------|
| PostHog | Product analytics, session replay, feature flags | `posthog` (npm) | `mcp__posthog__*` | `npx skills add posthog-setup` |
| Adapty | Paywalls, subscriptions, A/B testing | `adapty` (npm) | — | — |
| Firebase | Auth, Firestore, Analytics, Crashlytics | `firebase` (npm) | — | — |
| Meta/Facebook | Attribution, ad events, deep links | — | — | — |
| AppsFlyer | Install attribution, deep links | — | — | — |
| Superwall | Paywall experimentation (optional) | `superwall` | — | `npx skills add superwall-ios-quickstart` |
| App Store Connect | App management, subscriptions, TestFlight | `asc` (brew) | — | `npx skills add ios-marketing-capture` |
| Google Play Console | Android app management | — | — | — |

## Architecture Pattern

All SDK integrations MUST follow the **AnalyticsRouter pattern** — a single fan-out service that routes events to all providers. Never call SDKs directly from ViewModels or Views.

```
Views → ViewModels → AnalyticsRouter → [Firebase, PostHog, Meta, AppsFlyer]
                   → AdaptyService   → [Adapty SDK]
```

**Key principles:**
- SDK services are `private` — only the router touches them
- Revenue events use provider-specific conventions (`$revenue` for PostHog, `AFEventParamRevenue` for AppsFlyer)
- Feature flags from PostHog are exposed via the router
- Opt-out/opt-in (GDPR/ATT) flows through the router

**Graceful fallbacks:** When API keys are placeholders, SDKs auto-disable via guard checks in `SDKKeys`. No crashes, no error UI — just silent no-ops with DEBUG console warnings.

## Browser Automation (Playwright)

When CLI/API doesn't cover a task (e.g., Adapty paywall visual builder), use Playwright MCP.

### Setup

Playwright MCP must be configured to use the user's existing Chrome profile:

```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "<path-to>/playwright-mcp",
    "args": ["--browser", "chrome", "--user-data-dir", "<user-home>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"]
  }
}
```

**Critical:** The user must close Chrome before Playwright can use the profile. Always warn before launching.

### Authentication Flow

1. Navigate to the target dashboard (e.g., `https://app.adapty.io`)
2. If redirected to login → click "Sign in with Google" → Chrome profile handles OAuth automatically
3. Wait for redirect back to dashboard
4. Proceed with automation

### Dashboard Operations

| Dashboard | What to automate | How |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Adapty | Paywall visual builder, template selection | Playwright — no API available |
| PostHog | Project settings, dashboards | PostHog MCP (`mcp__posthog__*`) or CLI |
| Firebase | Project creation, service accounts | `firebase` CLI |
| App Store Connect | Everything | `asc` CLI (covers 95% of operations) |
| AppsFlyer | Dashboard setup | Playwright (limited API) |

### `/shipyard:init` — Initialize SDK integrations

Interactive setup wizard for a new or existing mobile app.

**Process:**

1. **Detect platform** — scan project files to identify iOS/Android/Flutter/RN
2. **Scan existing integrations** — check for already-installed SDKs (grep imports, check dependency files)
3. **Ask user** — "Which SDKs do you need?" with defaults:
   - [x] PostHog (analytics + session replay + feature flags)
   - [x] Firebase (auth + crashlytics)
   - [x] Adapty (paywalls + subscriptions)
   - [x] Meta (attribution)
   - [x] AppsFlyer (install attribution)
   - [ ] Superwall (optional — paywall experimentation)
4. **For each selected SDK:**
   a. Check if CLI is installed → install if missing
   b. Check if CLI is authenticated → authenticate if needed
   c. Check if API key exists → create app/project if needed, extract key
   d. Add SDK dependency to project (SPM/Gradle/pubspec/package.json)
   e. Create service class following the platform's patterns
   f. Wire into AnalyticsRouter (or create one if it doesn't exist)
   g. Add graceful fallback guards in SDKKeys
5. **Create SDKKeys config** — centralized key management with auto-derived enable flags
6. **Configure ATT/GDPR** — wire opt-in/opt-out through the router
7. **Validate** — build the project, check for errors

**Output:** Summary of what was set up, what keys are still placeholder, and next steps.

### `/shipyard:abilities` — Show available tools and gaps

Audit the development environment for mobile app tooling.

**Process:**

1. **Check installed CLIs:**
   ```bash
   which adapty firebase posthog asc superwall 2>/dev/null
   adapty auth status 2>/dev/null
   firebase login:list 2>/dev/null
   asc auth status 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. **Check MCP servers:**
   - Playwright MCP → connected? Chrome profile configured?
   - PostHog MCP → connected? Authenticated?
   - Context7 MCP → available for docs?
3. **Check installed skills:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude-shared/skills/ | grep -E "superwall|ios-marketing|posthog|firebase|adapty"
   ```
4. **Report:**
   ```
   READY:
   ✅ adapty CLI v0.1.5 — authenticated as semih
   ✅ asc CLI v1.2.1 — authenticated as Runlock
   ✅ Playwright MCP — Chrome profile configured

   MISSING:
   ❌ posthog CLI — install: npm i -g posthog-cli
   ❌ firebase CLI — install: npm i -g firebase-tools
   ⚠️ superwall CLI — optional, install: brew install superwall

   SKILLS TO ADD:
   📦 npx skills add ParthJadhav/ios-marketing-capture -g
   📦 npx skills add superwall-ios-quickstart -g
   ```
5. **Auto-fix option:** "Want me to install the missing tools now?"

### `/shipyard:setup <sdk>` — Set up a specific SDK

Deep setup for one SDK. Available SDKs: `posthog`, `adapty`, `firebase`, `meta`, `appsflyer`, `superwall`.

**Example: `/shipyard:setup adapty`**

1. Check `adapty` CLI installed and authenticated
2. Check if app exists → `adapty apps list` → create if not
3. Extract SDK key → update `SDKKeys.swift` (or platform equivalent)
4. Create access level `premium`
5. Create products (weekly/monthly/annual) with platform product IDs
6. Create paywalls (onboarding + upgrade) with all products
7. Create placements matching code constants
8. Open Playwright → Adapty dashboard → pick paywall template → customize copy → publish
9. Set up App Store server notifications URL via `asc app-setup`
10. Validate: build project, check SDK initialization

### `/shipyard:connect <store>` — Connect app stores

Set up app store integrations. Available: `appstore`, `playstore`.

**Example: `/shipyard:connect appstore`**

1. Authenticate `asc` CLI if not already
2. Create subscription group
3. Create subscription products with localized pricing
4. Add localizations (detect from project — e.g., TR + EN)
5. Set App Store server notification URL (for Adapty/RevenueCat webhook)
6. Configure sandbox testers
7. Upload review screenshots if available

### `/shipyard:dashboard <service>` — Open and configure a dashboard

Use Playwright to automate dashboard configuration.

**Process:**

1. **Pre-flight:** Check Playwright MCP is connected
2. **Warn user:** "I need to open Chrome with your profile. Please close Chrome if it's open."
3. **Navigate** to the dashboard (adapty/posthog/firebase/appstoreconnect)
4. **Authenticate** — use Google SSO via Chrome profile
5. **Perform configuration** — template selection, settings changes, etc.
6. **Screenshot** each step for verification
7. **Report** what was configured

### `/shipyard:status` — Overall integration health check

Quick overview of all SDK integrations in the current project.

1. Read `SDKKeys` (or equivalent) — check which keys are real vs placeholder
2. Check each service file for proper guard patterns
3. Verify AnalyticsRouter wiring
4. Check dependency versions (outdated?)
5. Report:
   ```
   SDK Status:
   ✅ PostHog — key set, session replay enabled, ATT wired
   ✅ Adapty — key set, 2 paywalls, 3 products, webhook configured
   ⚠️ AppsFlyer — placeholder key, will silently disable
   ⚠️ Meta — no FACEBOOK_APP_ID in build settings
   ✅ Firebase — configured, anonymous auth active
   ```

### `/shipyard:prices <territory>` — Set subscription pricing

Recommend and configure subscription prices for a specific market.

1. Research competitive pricing for the territory
2. Map to Apple/Google price tiers
3. Create/update subscriptions via `asc` CLI
4. Add localizations for the territory
5. Report pricing table with savings percentages

### `/shipyard:help` — Show all commands

Display the full command reference with examples.

## Tool Installation Commands

When abilities are missing, provide exact install commands:

```bash
# CLIs
npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
npm install -g adapty
npm install -g firebase-tools
brew install app-store-connect-cli  # provides `asc` binary

# Skills (add to Claude Code)
npx skills add ParthJadhav/ios-marketing-capture -g
npx skills add superwall-ios-quickstart -g
npx skills add superwall-flutter-quickstart -g
npx skills add superwall-android-quickstart -g
npx skills add superwall-expo-quickstart -g

# MCP servers
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
# PostHog MCP — available as built-in claude.ai MCP, authenticate via mcp__posthog__authenticate
```

## Chrome Session Management

**Always use the user's existing Chrome profile** for dashboard automation. This preserves:
- Google SSO sessions (Adapty, Firebase, PostHog)
- App Store Connect sessions
- Any dashboard sessions

**Config pattern (in settings.json `mcpServers`):**
```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "/path/to/playwright-mcp",
    "args": ["--browser", "chrome", "--user-data-dir", "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"]
  }
}
```

**Important notes:**
- User MUST close Chrome before Playwright can use the profile (Chrome locks it)
- After Playwright is done, user can reopen Chrome normally
- The `--user-data-dir` path varies by OS:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome`
  - Linux: `~/.config/google-chrome`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data`

## Dynamic Path Resolution

Never hardcode user-specific paths. Resolve dynamically:

```bash
# Home directory
HOME=$(eval echo ~)

# Node binary path
NODE_BIN=$(dirname $(which node))

# Chrome profile (macOS)
CHROME_PROFILE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"

# Project bundle ID
BUNDLE_ID=$(grep "PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER" project.yml | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | When to use together |
|-------|---------------------|
| `ship-wreck-check` | After `/shipyard:init` — verify SDK integration quality |
| `qgit` | After setup — commit and push changes |
| `ios-marketing-capture` | Capture App Store screenshots |
| `superwall-*-quickstart` | Platform-specific Superwall setup |
| `analytics-tracking` | Plan analytics event taxonomy |
| `app-store-optimization` | ASO after app store connection |
| `paywall-upgrade-cro` | Optimize paywall conversion after Adapty setup |

## Rules

- **Never hardcode paths** — resolve dynamically from environment
- **Always check before installing** — `which <tool>` before `npm install -g`
- **Always authenticate before using** — check auth status before CLI operations
- **Always use graceful fallbacks** — placeholder keys = silent disable, not crash
- **Always follow platform conventions** — SPM for iOS, Gradle for Android, etc.
- **Always use the AnalyticsRouter pattern** — never call SDKs directly from UI
- **Always preserve existing code** — read before writing, extend don't replace
- **Always warn before Playwright** — user must close Chrome first
- **Revenue events need provider-specific formatting** — `$revenue` for PostHog, `AFEventParamRevenue` for AppsFlyer, etc.
- **Client SDK keys are safe to compile** — they're public tokens, not server secrets
