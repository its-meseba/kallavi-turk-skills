# Shipyard

Professional mobile app development automation. One skill to set up, configure, and manage every SDK, CLI tool, and dashboard your app needs — across iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin/Compose), Flutter, and React Native (Expo).

## Philosophy

**CLI-first, browser-fallback, code-always.** Every action follows this priority:
1. **CLI tool** — fastest, scriptable, repeatable (adapty, asc, firebase, posthog)
2. **REST API** — when CLI doesn't cover it (curl with auth tokens)
3. **Playwright browser** — when dashboards have no API (visual builders, OAuth flows)
4. **Manual guidance** — last resort, with exact click-by-click instructions

## Platform Detection

Before any setup, detect the project platform:

```
project.yml / *.xcodeproj     → iOS (SwiftUI)
build.gradle.kts / build.gradle → Android (Kotlin/Compose)
pubspec.yaml                   → Flutter
package.json + app.json/app.config.js → React Native (Expo)
```

Adapt ALL SDK integration patterns to the detected platform:
- **iOS**: SPM packages in `project.yml` or `Package.swift`, Swift service classes, `@MainActor` patterns
- **Android**: Gradle dependencies, Kotlin service classes, Hilt DI
- **Flutter**: `pubspec.yaml` dependencies, Dart service classes, Provider/Riverpod
- **React Native**: `package.json` dependencies, TypeScript service modules, hooks

## SDK Registry

| SDK | Purpose | CLI | MCP | Install Skill |
|-----|---------|-----|-----|---------------|
| PostHog | Product analytics, session replay, feature flags | `posthog` (npm) | `mcp__posthog__*` | `npx skills add posthog-setup` |
| Adapty | Paywalls, subscriptions, A/B testing | `adapty` (npm) | — | — |
| Firebase | Auth, Firestore, Analytics, Crashlytics | `firebase` (npm) | — | — |
| Meta/Facebook | Attribution, ad events, deep links | — | — | — |
| AppsFlyer | Install attribution, deep links | — | — | — |
| Superwall | Paywall experimentation (optional) | `superwall` | — | `npx skills add superwall-ios-quickstart` |
| App Store Connect | App management, subscriptions, TestFlight | `asc` (brew) | — | `npx skills add ios-marketing-capture` |
| Google Play Console | Android app management | — | — | — |

## Architecture Pattern

All SDK integrations MUST follow the **AnalyticsRouter pattern** — a single fan-out service that routes events to all providers. Never call SDKs directly from ViewModels or Views.

```
Views → ViewModels → AnalyticsRouter → [Firebase, PostHog, Meta, AppsFlyer]
                   → AdaptyService   → [Adapty SDK]
```

**Key principles:**
- SDK services are `private` — only the router touches them
- Revenue events use provider-specific conventions (`$revenue` for PostHog, `AFEventParamRevenue` for AppsFlyer)
- Feature flags from PostHog are exposed via the router
- Opt-out/opt-in (GDPR/ATT) flows through the router

**Graceful fallbacks:** When API keys are placeholders, SDKs auto-disable via guard checks in `SDKKeys`. No crashes, no error UI — just silent no-ops with DEBUG console warnings.

## Browser Automation (Playwright)

When CLI/API doesn't cover a task (e.g., Adapty paywall visual builder), use Playwright MCP.

**Always dispatch Playwright work as a subagent** — never inline browser automation in the main context. Use the Agent tool with the appropriate model tier based on task complexity (see Model Selection below).

### Model Selection for Playwright Subagents

Pick the model based on how much reasoning the browser task requires:

| Model | Use when | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Haiku** | Pure mechanical action — click, type, navigate, screenshot. No decisions needed. | Filling a form with known values, clicking a known button, navigating to a URL, taking screenshots for verification |
| **Sonnet** | Needs to understand UI structure, pick from options, adapt to what it sees on screen. | Selecting a paywall template, customizing copy fields, navigating an unfamiliar dashboard flow |
| **Opus** | Complex multi-step flows with branching decisions, error recovery, or ambiguous UI states. | Setting up a completely new dashboard with many unknown steps, recovering from auth failures mid-flow, cross-dashboard orchestration |

**Default:** Start with Haiku. If the task requires judgment calls (which template to pick, how to interpret UI), use Sonnet. Reserve Opus for flows that repeatedly fail or require deep reasoning about the UI state.

### Dispatching Playwright Subagents

Use the Agent tool. Always include in the prompt:
1. Current browser state (URL, what's visible)
2. Exact steps to perform (the more specific, the better for Haiku)
3. What copy/values to enter
4. What to return (screenshots paths, what succeeded/failed)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fill Adapty paywall form fields",
  model: "haiku",          // or "sonnet" / "opus"
  prompt: "The browser is already at https://app.adapty.io/paywalls/123/edit.
           Click the headline field (ref: e42), clear it, type 'Touch Grass First'.
           Click Save. Take a screenshot. Return: success/failure + screenshot path."
})
```

### Setup

Playwright MCP must be configured to use the user's existing Chrome profile:

```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "<path-to>/playwright-mcp",
    "args": ["--browser", "chrome", "--user-data-dir", "<user-home>/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"]
  }
}
```

**Critical:** The user must close Chrome before Playwright can use the profile. Always warn before launching.

### Authentication Flow

1. Navigate to the target dashboard (e.g., `https://app.adapty.io`)
2. If redirected to login → click "Sign in with Google" → Chrome profile handles OAuth automatically
3. Wait for redirect back to dashboard
4. Proceed with automation

### Dashboard Operations

| Dashboard | What to automate | Model | How |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|-----|
| Adapty | Paywall visual builder, template selection | Sonnet | Playwright subagent — no API available |
| Adapty | Simple field edits, button clicks after builder is open | Haiku | Playwright subagent |
| PostHog | Project settings, dashboards | Haiku | PostHog MCP (`mcp__posthog__*`) or CLI preferred |
| Firebase | Project creation, service accounts | Haiku | `firebase` CLI preferred |
| App Store Connect | Everything | Haiku | `asc` CLI (covers 95% of operations) |
| AppsFlyer | Dashboard setup, complex flows | Sonnet | Playwright subagent (limited API) |

### `/shipyard:init` — Initialize SDK integrations

Interactive setup wizard for a new or existing mobile app.

**Process:**

1. **Detect platform** — scan project files to identify iOS/Android/Flutter/RN
2. **Scan existing integrations** — check for already-installed SDKs (grep imports, check dependency files)
3. **Ask user** — "Which SDKs do you need?" with defaults:
   - [x] PostHog (analytics + session replay + feature flags)
   - [x] Firebase (auth + crashlytics)
   - [x] Adapty (paywalls + subscriptions)
   - [x] Meta (attribution)
   - [x] AppsFlyer (install attribution)
   - [ ] Superwall (optional — paywall experimentation)
4. **For each selected SDK:**
   a. Check if CLI is installed → install if missing
   b. Check if CLI is authenticated → authenticate if needed
   c. Check if API key exists → create app/project if needed, extract key
   d. Add SDK dependency to project (SPM/Gradle/pubspec/package.json)
   e. Create service class following the platform's patterns
   f. Wire into AnalyticsRouter (or create one if it doesn't exist)
   g. Add graceful fallback guards in SDKKeys
5. **Create SDKKeys config** — centralized key management with auto-derived enable flags
6. **Configure ATT/GDPR** — wire opt-in/opt-out through the router
7. **Validate** — build the project, check for errors

**Output:** Summary of what was set up, what keys are still placeholder, and next steps.

### `/shipyard:abilities` — Show available tools and gaps

Audit the development environment for mobile app tooling.

**Process:**

1. **Check installed CLIs:**
   ```bash
   which adapty firebase posthog asc superwall 2>/dev/null
   adapty auth status 2>/dev/null
   firebase login:list 2>/dev/null
   asc auth status 2>/dev/null
   ```
2. **Check MCP servers:**
   - Playwright MCP → connected? Chrome profile configured?
   - PostHog MCP → connected? Authenticated?
   - Context7 MCP → available for docs?
3. **Check installed skills:**
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude-shared/skills/ | grep -E "superwall|ios-marketing|posthog|firebase|adapty"
   ```
4. **Report:**
   ```
   READY:
   ✅ adapty CLI v0.1.5 — authenticated as semih
   ✅ asc CLI v1.2.1 — authenticated as Runlock
   ✅ Playwright MCP — Chrome profile configured

   MISSING:
   ❌ posthog CLI — install: npm i -g posthog-cli
   ❌ firebase CLI — install: npm i -g firebase-tools
   ⚠️ superwall CLI — optional, install: brew install superwall

   SKILLS TO ADD:
   📦 npx skills add ParthJadhav/ios-marketing-capture -g
   📦 npx skills add superwall-ios-quickstart -g
   ```
5. **Auto-fix option:** "Want me to install the missing tools now?"

### `/shipyard:setup <sdk>` — Set up a specific SDK

Deep setup for one SDK. Available SDKs: `posthog`, `adapty`, `firebase`, `meta`, `appsflyer`, `superwall`.

**Example: `/shipyard:setup adapty`**

1. Check `adapty` CLI installed and authenticated
2. Check if app exists → `adapty apps list` → create if not
3. Extract SDK key → update `SDKKeys.swift` (or platform equivalent)
4. Create access level `premium`
5. Create products (weekly/monthly/annual) with platform product IDs
6. Create paywalls (onboarding + upgrade) with all products
7. Create placements matching code constants
8. Open Playwright → Adapty dashboard → pick paywall template → customize copy → publish
9. Set up App Store server notifications URL via `asc app-setup`
10. Validate: build project, check SDK initialization

### `/shipyard:connect <store>` — Connect app stores

Set up app store integrations. Available: `appstore`, `playstore`.

**Example: `/shipyard:connect appstore`**

1. Authenticate `asc` CLI if not already
2. Create subscription group
3. Create subscription products with localized pricing
4. Add localizations (detect from project — e.g., TR + EN)
5. Set App Store server notification URL (for Adapty/RevenueCat webhook)
6. Configure sandbox testers
7. Upload review screenshots if available

### `/shipyard:dashboard <service>` — Open and configure a dashboard

Use Playwright to automate dashboard configuration.

**Process:**

1. **Pre-flight:** Check Playwright MCP is connected
2. **Warn user:** "I need to open Chrome with your profile. Please close Chrome if it's open."
3. **Navigate** to the dashboard (adapty/posthog/firebase/appstoreconnect)
4. **Authenticate** — use Google SSO via Chrome profile
5. **Perform configuration** — template selection, settings changes, etc.
6. **Screenshot** each step for verification
7. **Report** what was configured

### `/shipyard:status` — Overall integration health check

Quick overview of all SDK integrations in the current project.

1. Read `SDKKeys` (or equivalent) — check which keys are real vs placeholder
2. Check each service file for proper guard patterns
3. Verify AnalyticsRouter wiring
4. Check dependency versions (outdated?)
5. Report:
   ```
   SDK Status:
   ✅ PostHog — key set, session replay enabled, ATT wired
   ✅ Adapty — key set, 2 paywalls, 3 products, webhook configured
   ⚠️ AppsFlyer — placeholder key, will silently disable
   ⚠️ Meta — no FACEBOOK_APP_ID in build settings
   ✅ Firebase — configured, anonymous auth active
   ```

### `/shipyard:prices <territory>` — Set subscription pricing

Recommend and configure subscription prices for a specific market.

1. Research competitive pricing for the territory
2. Map to Apple/Google price tiers
3. Create/update subscriptions via `asc` CLI
4. Add localizations for the territory
5. Report pricing table with savings percentages

### `/shipyard:init-skills` — Auto-install platform skills

Detects the project platform and installs all relevant Claude Code skills via `git clone` to `~/.claude-shared/skills/`.

**Process:**

1. **Detect platform** — scan project files (see Platform Detection above)
2. **Resolve skill directory** — `SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude-shared/skills"`
3. **For each skill in the platform registry:**
   a. Check if `$SKILLS_DIR/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` already exists → skip if present
   b. `git clone <repo-url> $SKILLS_DIR/<skill-name>`
   c. If SKILL.md is nested (e.g., `<skill-name>/<nested-dir>/SKILL.md`), flatten: `cp -r <nested-dir>/* .`
   d. Verify `SKILL.md` exists at root level
4. **Update project CLAUDE.md** — read the project's `CLAUDE.md`, find the platform rules section, and add `Skill Reference` lines for every installed skill that isn't already listed. Each line follows the format:
   ```
   - **Skill Reference**: Use `<skill-name>` skill for <purpose>
   ```
   Only add references for skills relevant to the detected platform. Do NOT duplicate references that already exist in the file.
5. **Report:** installed count, skipped count, any failures, CLAUDE.md references added

## Tool Installation Commands

When abilities are missing, provide exact install commands:

```bash
# CLIs
npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
npm install -g adapty
npm install -g firebase-tools
brew install app-store-connect-cli  # provides `asc` binary

# Skills (clone to ~/.claude-shared/skills/)
# Use /shipyard:init-skills to auto-install all platform skills
# Manual install example:
SKILLS_DIR="$HOME/.claude-shared/skills"
git clone https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill.git "$SKILLS_DIR/swiftui-pro"
# If SKILL.md is nested, flatten: cd "$SKILLS_DIR/swiftui-pro" && cp -r swiftui-pro/* . 2>/dev/null

# MCP servers
claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
# PostHog MCP — available as built-in claude.ai MCP, authenticate via mcp__posthog__authenticate
```

## Chrome Session Management

**Always use the user's existing Chrome profile** for dashboard automation. This preserves:
- Google SSO sessions (Adapty, Firebase, PostHog)
- App Store Connect sessions
- Any dashboard sessions

**Config pattern (in settings.json `mcpServers`):**
```json
{
  "playwright": {
    "command": "/path/to/playwright-mcp",
    "args": ["--browser", "chrome", "--user-data-dir", "~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"]
  }
}
```

**Important notes:**
- User MUST close Chrome before Playwright can use the profile (Chrome locks it)
- After Playwright is done, user can reopen Chrome normally
- The `--user-data-dir` path varies by OS:
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome`
  - Linux: `~/.config/google-chrome`
  - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data`

## Dynamic Path Resolution

Never hardcode user-specific paths. Resolve dynamically:

```bash
# Home directory
HOME=$(eval echo ~)

# Node binary path
NODE_BIN=$(dirname $(which node))

# Chrome profile (macOS)
CHROME_PROFILE="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"

# Project bundle ID
BUNDLE_ID=$(grep "PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER" project.yml | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
```

## Integration with Other Skills

| Skill | When to use together |
|-------|---------------------|
| `ship-wreck-check` | After `/shipyard:init` — verify SDK integration quality |
| `qgit` | After setup — commit and push changes |
| `ios-marketing-capture` | Capture App Store screenshots |
| `superwall-*-quickstart` | Platform-specific Superwall setup |
| `analytics-tracking` | Plan analytics event taxonomy |
| `app-store-optimization` | ASO after app store connection |
| `paywall-upgrade-cro` | Optimize paywall conversion after Adapty setup |
| `app-onboarding-questionnaire` | Design and build questionnaire-style onboarding flows (Duolingo/Noom pattern) |
| `swiftui-pro` | Advanced SwiftUI patterns — auto-installed by `/shipyard:init-skills` |
| `swift-concurrency-pro` | Async/await and structured concurrency — auto-installed by `/shipyard:init-skills` |
| `swift-testing-pro` | Swift Testing framework patterns — auto-installed by `/shipyard:init-skills` |
| `swift-architecture` | Architecture patterns (MVVM, Clean, etc.) — auto-installed by `/shipyard:init-skills` |
| `swift-security-expert` | iOS security best practices — auto-installed by `/shipyard:init-skills` |

## Rules

- **Never hardcode paths** — resolve dynamically from environment
- **Always check before installing** — `which <tool>` before `npm install -g`
- **Always authenticate before using** — check auth status before CLI operations
- **Always use graceful fallbacks** — placeholder keys = silent disable, not crash
- **Always follow platform conventions** — SPM for iOS, Gradle for Android, etc.
- **Always use the AnalyticsRouter pattern** — never call SDKs directly from UI
- **Always preserve existing code** — read before writing, extend don't replace
- **Always warn before Playwright** — user must close Chrome first
- **Revenue events need provider-specific formatting** — `$revenue` for PostHog, `AFEventParamRevenue` for AppsFlyer, etc.
- **Client SDK keys are safe to compile** — they're public tokens, not server secrets
